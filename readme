#A1

-> slider (ranges from Rs.0 - Rs.1000) in steps of 25
-> price_values (gap of Rs.25)
-> difference default (l-> 300, r-> 700)
-> total_range (r-l)/(r+l)*100

-> basic functionality:
    used div tags for distinction

-> Basic Formulae:
    the basic formula which we can use to determine range is (r-l)/(r+l)*100

-> to run the code -> right click -> open with live server



#A2

Create separate div tabs for phases and speed
phases: ->night ->dawn -> day -> dusk
speed: ->slow ->normal ->fast

-> using keyframes we can make this possible



#A3

-> we can make this possible dynamically using keyframes


#A4

-> a text is provided
-> search-box implementation
-> highlight matching words
-> find the count of distinct words using key:value pairs
-> sumit and clear buttons
-> error message

-> basic functionality:
    using dictionary (key:value pairs) we can easily figure out the count of distinct keywords



#A5

-> basic functionality is the usage of opacity


#A6

-> basic functionality is the usage of shadow keys at the right destination
